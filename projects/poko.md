Poko is a Y Combinator-backed startup connecting wallets, wallet-as-a-service (WaaS) providers, NFT marketplaces, web3 games and dApps to local payment rails. Our Onramp Aggregator SDK enables web3 product users from anywhere to purchase crypto natively using local payment methods for 5x transaction success rates and 70% less cost. Our Direct Checkout solution enables a one-step NFT purchasing or staking directly using fiat for users. Offramp is on our product roadmap. We are registered in Singapore and currently support 30+ payment methods and 120+ countries.
