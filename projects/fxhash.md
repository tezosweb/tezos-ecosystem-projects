fxhash is an open platform where artists can mint Generative Tokens which are stored on the Tezos blockchain. Generative Tokens are programs designed to produce random outputs. Once a Generative Token is enabled (when the artist decides it), anyone with a tezos wallet can mint its own unique iteration of the Generative Token. Each iteration produces a unique piece that is stored as a NFT on the tezos blockchain. The NFT are FA2 compliant, which means that they can be exchanged like any other NFT.
