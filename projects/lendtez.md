LendTez is an open-source, decentralised, peer-to-peer lending and borrowing protocol with no fee and no liquidation where users can participate as borrowers or lenders. Borrowers can borrow XTZ and Tezos-based tokens built with the FA token standards (FA1.2 and FA2), while lenders provide liquidity.
