TEA stands for a small, adaptable, and self-contained development environment tailored for Tezos smart contracts. With minimal dependencies, its total size is only around ~1.2MB. The behavior of TEA is determined by `app.hjson`, and adjustments can be made via `ami.lua`. Its self-contained nature allows developers to modify features according to their needs.

TEA facilitates faster Tezos project development, aiming to streamline the process more swiftly than the time it takes to prepare a cup of tea. It offers `ligo` compilation and testing, a `taquito`-based module for dapp development, and end-to-end tests with `taquito` and sandbox. Although `SmartPy` is not currently supported, the adaptability of TEA ensures it could be integrated if necessary.
